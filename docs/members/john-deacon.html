          <p><b>Biography:</b></p>
          <p>
            John Richard Deacon (born 19 August 1951) is an English retired
            musician, best known for being the bass guitarist for the rock band
            Queen. He composed several singles for the group—including Top 10
            hits "You're My Best Friend", "Another One Bites the Dust", "Back
            Chat", and "I Want to Break Free"—and was involved in the band's
            financial management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deacon grew up in Oadby, Leicestershire, playing bass in a local
            band, The Opposition, before moving to study electronics at Chelsea
            College, London. He joined Queen in 1971 on the strength of his
            musical and electronic skills, particularly the home-made Deacy Amp
            which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras
            throughout Queen's career. From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack,
            onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which
            became hits. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar and
            keyboards on Queen's studio work, but was the only member never to
            sing on their records, though he did contribute backing vocals
            during live performances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following frontman Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, and the
            following year's Tribute Concert, Deacon only performed a few times
            with the remaining members of Queen before retiring from the music
            industry in 1997 after recording "No-One but You (Only the Good Die
            Young)". He has not performed on any of the other projects that the
            other two surviving members, May and Roger Taylor, have put
            together.
